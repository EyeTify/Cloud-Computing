## üîé Features

- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication using Firebase.
- **News Fetching**: Fetch and display news articles from external providers.
- **Machine Learning**: Analyze uploaded images for eye disease detection using a machine learning model.

## üîó APIs

### Authentication API

- **Endpoint**: `https://asia-southeast2-eyetifycapstone.cloudfunctions.net/app/api`
- **Methods**:
  - `POST /register`: Register a new user.
  - `POST /login`: Authenticate an existing user.
  - `POST /reset-password`: Change user password.
  - `POST /logout`: Logging out user account

### News Fetching API

- **Base URL**: `https://articles-features-api-kodyfcb2bq-et.a.run.app`
- **Methods**:
  - `GET /health-news`: Fetch the latest news articles.
  - `GET /search-articles`: Search for news articles based on keywords.

### Machine Learning API

- **Endpoint**: `https://ml-model-api-kodyfcb2bq-et.a.run.app/api/upload-analyze`
- **Methods**:
  - `POST /image`: Analyze the uploaded image for eye disease detection.

## üîß Architecture

### Interaction between components:

1. **Clients**
   - Users of the EyeTify application on mobile devices perform actions, such as logging in or uploading images.

2. **Backend Services**
   - **Firebase Authentication**: Manage user authentication. When a user signs in, Firebase Authentication verifies their credentials.
   - **Cloud Run Backend API**: Once the user is authenticated, Cloud Run handles API requests from the client application. For example, when a user uploads an image for analysis.
   - **Cloud Storage**: Cloud Run uploads images sent by users to Cloud Storage for storage and stores ML Models.
   - **Firestore Database**: Cloud Run can also store and retrieve related data from the Firestore Database, such as image analysis results that have been processed by machine learning models.

3. **CI/CD using Cloud Build**
   - **GitHub Repository**: Developers manage project source code in the GitHub Repository. Every time there is a code change (commit/push), it will trigger the CI/CD process.
   - **Cloud Trigger**: Cloud Trigger monitors changes in the GitHub Repository and triggers Cloud Build to start the build process.
   - **Docker Images**: Cloud Build takes source code, builds a Docker image, and uploads it to Google Container Registry.
   - **Container Registry**: Saves a Docker image ready to deploy to Cloud Run.

4. **Access Control and Billing**
   - **Cloud IAM**: Manage user identities and access to secure access to cloud resources.
   - **Cloud Billing**: Manage and monitor costs for using Google Cloud services.

We follows a microservices architecture, where each API is deployed independently to ensure modularity and scalability.
